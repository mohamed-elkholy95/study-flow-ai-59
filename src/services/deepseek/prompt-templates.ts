3. Applications (2-3 real-world uses): Each 15-25 words, practical and relevant
4. Common Pitfalls (1-2 misconceptions): Clear misconception + correct understanding
5. Next Steps (actionable follow-up): Concrete suggestions for continued learning

CONTENT QUALITY RULES:
- Write complete, natural content with NO placeholders whatsoever
- Include specific, working examples for each core concept (not generic examples)
- Use parallel structure in lists and maintain logical flow
- Target 200-400 total words with precise section lengths

Structure your response with these sections, but write them naturally:

## Topic Introduction
Write 20-30 words explaining what this topic is and why it's important.

## Core Concepts
Create 3-5 core concepts, each as a subsection with:
- A descriptive heading (### format)
- 40-60 words of clear explanation
- A specific, concrete example introduced with "**Example:**"

## Applications  
List 2-3 real-world applications as bullet points, each 15-25 words describing where this concept is used.

## Common Pitfalls
Include 1-2 common misconceptions using this format:
**Misconception:** Write the actual wrong belief students commonly have
**Reality:** Write the correct understanding with clear explanation

## Next Steps
Provide 2-3 actionable bullet points for what the student should do next to deepen their understanding.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Write complete, natural content - NO brackets [ ], NO placeholders, NO template text
