# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the complete migration of the StudyFlow AI backend from the current Supabase/TypeScript Edge Functions architecture to a comprehensive Go Lang backend system. The migration will maintain all existing functionality while improving performance, scalability, and maintainability through Go's superior concurrency model and type safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Backend Infrastructure Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend migrated to Go Lang, so that we have better performance, type safety, and easier deployment management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% API compatibility with existing frontend clients
2. WHEN requests are made to any endpoint THEN the Go backend SHALL respond with identical data structures and status codes as the current system
3. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL initialize all required services within 5 seconds
4. IF any service fails to start THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and gracefully shut down
5. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables and API keys

### Requirement 2: Database Layer Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust database layer in Go, so that we have type-safe database operations and better query performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling with configurable limits
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL be protected against SQL injection through prepared statements
3. WHEN database migrations run THEN they SHALL be versioned and reversible
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
5. WHEN transactions are used THEN they SHALL properly handle rollbacks on errors
6. WHEN database schemas are defined THEN they SHALL match exactly with current Supabase schema

### Requirement 3: Authentication and Authorization System

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication that works seamlessly, so that my data remains protected while maintaining ease of use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL support JWT token validation compatible with Supabase Auth
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be validated against user permissions and rate limits
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for token refresh
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block the request
5. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN they SHALL support concurrent sessions across devices

### Requirement 4: AI Service Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a student, I want AI tutoring functionality to work exactly as before, so that my learning experience is not disrupted during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI requests are made THEN the system SHALL support all current providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek)
2. WHEN an AI provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to available providers
3. WHEN API keys are managed THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest and in transit
4. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN streaming responses are requested THEN the system SHALL support real-time AI response streaming
6. WHEN AI responses are processed THEN they SHALL be validated for educational content appropriateness

### Requirement 5: RESTful API Layer

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all existing API endpoints to work identically, so that no frontend changes are required during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL maintain exact compatibility with current Supabase Edge Functions
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN they SHALL include proper CORS headers for frontend compatibility
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL return consistent error formats with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. IF request validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation error messages
5. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN it SHALL be automatically updated from code annotations

### Requirement 6: Real-time Features and WebSocket Support

**User Study:** As a user, I want real-time features like live study sessions and notifications, so that I have an interactive learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL support real-time study session updates
2. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL be delivered in real-time to connected clients
3. WHEN multiple users collaborate THEN the system SHALL synchronize state across all participants
4. IF WebSocket connections drop THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt reconnection
5. WHEN real-time events occur THEN they SHALL be properly authenticated and authorized

### Requirement 7: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and performance metrics, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL log response times and resource usage
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be tracked with detailed context and stack traces
3. WHEN system metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include CPU, memory, database, and API usage statistics
4. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL verify all critical system components

### Requirement 8: Security and Encryption

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my data to be protected with enterprise-grade security, so that my personal information and study data remain safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN API communications occur THEN they SHALL use TLS 1.3 or higher
3. WHEN API keys are managed THEN they SHALL be stored in secure vaults with rotation capabilities
4. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log events and trigger security alerts
5. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL include integrity checks and validation

### Requirement 9: Deployment and DevOps Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want streamlined deployment processes, so that I can deploy updates safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL produce a single binary with all dependencies
2. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL support zero-downtime rolling updates
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN they SHALL be applied without requiring application restart
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version
5. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL verify application readiness before serving traffic

### Requirement 10: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want all my data to be preserved during migration, so that I don't lose any study progress or settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data migration runs THEN it SHALL preserve 100% of existing user data
2. WHEN data structures are converted THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity
3. WHEN migration completes THEN it SHALL provide detailed migration reports
4. IF migration errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with rollback procedures
5. WHEN data validation runs THEN it SHALL verify data consistency between old and new systems
