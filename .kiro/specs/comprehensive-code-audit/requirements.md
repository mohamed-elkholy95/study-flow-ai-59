# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses a comprehensive security and code quality audit of the educational SaaS platform (Study Management System). The platform is built with React/TypeScript/Supabase and requires systematic evaluation across security vulnerabilities, database integrity, code quality, dependency management, feature completeness, and testing infrastructure. The audit aims to transform the current codebase from its existing state to enterprise-ready standards with a target security score improvement from 86/100 to 95/100.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Vulnerability Assessment

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want a comprehensive security audit of the authentication system, API integrations, and data protection mechanisms, so that I can ensure user data is protected and the platform meets enterprise security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security audit is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan all authentication flows including Supabase Auth and Google OAuth integration
2. WHEN reviewing API security THEN the system SHALL identify and document all API key exposure risks for Gemini, Claude, and OpenAI integrations
3. WHEN analyzing database security THEN the system SHALL audit all Row Level Security (RLS) policies for effectiveness and coverage
4. WHEN testing data protection THEN the system SHALL verify HMAC signing implementation and data encryption in transit and at rest
5. WHEN evaluating access controls THEN the system SHALL test rate limiting mechanisms and CORS configurations
6. WHEN completing the security scan THEN the system SHALL generate a report with vulnerability severity ratings and remediation steps

### Requirement 2: Code Quality and Maintenance Audit

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to identify and resolve code quality issues including console statements, type safety problems, and dead code, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for debugging artifacts THEN the system SHALL identify and catalog all 679 console.log statements for removal
2. WHEN analyzing TypeScript usage THEN the system SHALL identify all instances of `any` types and provide type-safe alternatives
3. WHEN reviewing code completeness THEN the system SHALL locate and resolve all TODO items in the codebase
4. WHEN analyzing component architecture THEN the system SHALL identify dead code and unused components across 100+ components
5. WHEN performing static analysis THEN the system SHALL run TypeScript strict mode analysis and report type errors
6. WHEN completing code review THEN the system SHALL provide a prioritized list of code quality improvements

### Requirement 3: Database Integrity and Performance Review

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to ensure the Supabase PostgreSQL database schema is optimized, secure, and properly configured, so that data operations are efficient and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing database schema THEN the system SHALL analyze table structures, indexes, and relationships for optimization opportunities
2. WHEN reviewing security policies THEN the system SHALL test all RLS policies with different user roles and permissions
3. WHEN analyzing Edge Functions THEN the system SHALL scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities and performance issues
4. WHEN evaluating query performance THEN the system SHALL profile database queries and identify slow operations
5. WHEN testing data integrity THEN the system SHALL validate all foreign key relationships and constraints
6. WHEN completing database review THEN the system SHALL provide performance optimization recommendations

### Requirement 4: Dependency Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to ensure all project dependencies are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities, so that the platform is protected from supply chain attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify all 57 outdated packages and their update requirements
2. WHEN checking for vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL run automated security scans using npm audit and vulnerability databases
3. WHEN analyzing licenses THEN the system SHALL review all dependency licenses for compliance issues
4. WHEN planning updates THEN the system SHALL categorize updates by risk level (patch/minor/major) and breaking changes
5. WHEN testing updates THEN the system SHALL validate that dependency updates don't break existing functionality
6. WHEN completing dependency audit THEN the system SHALL provide an update strategy with risk assessment

### Requirement 5: Feature Completeness and Functionality Verification

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to verify that all platform features are working correctly and completely implemented, so that users have a reliable and fully functional learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing core features THEN the system SHALL verify all 10 key platform features are functioning as designed
2. WHEN testing Pomodoro timer THEN the system SHALL validate edge cases and timer accuracy
3. WHEN testing AI integrations THEN the system SHALL verify failover mechanisms between AI providers (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI)
4. WHEN testing spaced repetition THEN the system SHALL validate the algorithm implementation and scheduling accuracy
5. WHEN testing export functionality THEN the system SHALL verify PDF export generation and content accuracy
6. WHEN completing feature testing THEN the system SHALL provide a feature completeness matrix with pass/fail status

### Requirement 6: Testing Infrastructure Implementation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the platform, so that future changes can be validated automatically and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing unit tests THEN the system SHALL achieve 80% code coverage target using Jest and React Testing Library
2. WHEN creating integration tests THEN the system SHALL test all API calls and external service integrations
3. WHEN implementing E2E tests THEN the system SHALL cover critical user paths using Cypress or similar framework
4. WHEN setting up test automation THEN the system SHALL configure pre-commit hooks for automated testing
5. WHEN testing cross-browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL validate functionality across major browsers
6. WHEN completing test implementation THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports and test documentation

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive documentation and deployment procedures, so that the platform can be reliably deployed and maintained in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL generate updated README with setup and deployment instructions
2. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive API documentation for all endpoints
3. WHEN preparing deployment THEN the system SHALL create deployment checklists and procedures
4. WHEN benchmarking performance THEN the system SHALL establish baseline performance metrics
5. WHEN finalizing audit THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive audit report with before/after comparisons
6. WHEN completing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide maintenance procedures and troubleshooting guides
