## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing DeepSeek integration in the AI tutor interface to ensure proper markdown rendering capabilities. The goal is to display DeepSeek API responses in their original markdown format within the web application's AI tutor interface, maintaining the exact structure and information provided by the API without any modifications to the content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student using the AI tutor with DeepSeek, I want to verify that DeepSeek responses are properly formatted and displayed so that I can read the content clearly with all markdown elements rendered correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek returns a response THEN the system SHALL display it using the existing markdown rendering pipeline
2. WHEN DeepSeek responses contain complex markdown THEN the system SHALL preserve all formatting without content modification
3. WHEN there are rendering issues with DeepSeek responses THEN the system SHALL log the issue and display the raw content as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student receiving DeepSeek responses, I want all markdown elements to be properly rendered so that I can read structured, well-formatted content with code blocks, lists, and formatting intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek returns responses with code blocks THEN the system SHALL display them with proper syntax highlighting using the existing code rendering system
2. WHEN DeepSeek responses contain mathematical expressions THEN the system SHALL render them using the same math rendering as other providers
3. WHEN DeepSeek responses contain tables, lists, headers, or other markdown elements THEN the system SHALL preserve their original formatting and structure
4. WHEN DeepSeek responses contain nested markdown elements THEN the system SHALL render them correctly without breaking the layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer testing the AI tutor, I want to verify that DeepSeek responses are processed through the same validation and quality pipeline as other providers so that consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek returns a response THEN the system SHALL process it through the existing RequiredResponseStructure validation
2. WHEN DeepSeek responses fail validation THEN the system SHALL use the same fallback mechanisms as other providers
3. WHEN DeepSeek responses are processed THEN the system SHALL generate the same quality assessment metrics as other providers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student using the AI tutor interface, I want DeepSeek responses to appear seamlessly in the chat interface so that I have a consistent user experience regardless of the AI provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a DeepSeek response THEN the system SHALL display it in the existing MessageBubble component with proper markdown rendering
2. WHEN DeepSeek is processing a request THEN the system SHALL show the same thinking bubble animation used for other providers
3. WHEN DeepSeek responses are streamed THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time using the existing streaming infrastructure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify that DeepSeek markdown rendering works correctly across different response types so that all content is properly displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek generates explanation responses THEN the system SHALL render markdown formatting for headers, emphasis, and lists
2. WHEN DeepSeek generates code responses THEN the system SHALL render code blocks with appropriate language syntax highlighting
3. WHEN DeepSeek generates structured responses THEN the system SHALL render tables, nested lists, and complex formatting correctly
4. WHEN DeepSeek responses contain special characters or unicode THEN the system SHALL display them without encoding issues
