# AI Integration and UI Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StudyFlow AI application currently has several critical issues with its AI integration and user interface that prevent optimal user experience and functionality. The AI tutor feature, which is a core component of the application, suffers from reliability issues, inconsistent UI behavior, and integration problems that need comprehensive fixes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable AI Service Integration

**User Story:** As a student using the AI tutor, I want the AI service to work consistently and reliably, so that I can get help with my studies without encountering errors or service interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the AI tutor THEN the system SHALL successfully process the request through the primary service or automatically fallback to backup services
2. WHEN the primary AI service (edge function) fails THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch to the fallback DeepSeek API without user intervention
3. WHEN circuit breakers are triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically reset them and retry failed requests
4. WHEN API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable guidance
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and inform users of wait times
6. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Enhanced User Interface Experience

**User Story:** As a student, I want the AI tutor interface to be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing, so that I can focus on learning rather than struggling with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI is processing a request THEN the system SHALL display meaningful thinking states with progress indicators
2. WHEN messages are being streamed THEN the system SHALL show real-time typing indicators and smooth content updates
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery options
4. WHEN the chat history is long THEN the system SHALL implement efficient scrolling and message virtualization
5. WHEN users interact with quick actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and smooth transitions
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN all components SHALL render within 2 seconds on standard devices

### Requirement 3: Improved Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to gracefully handle errors and provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues, so that I can continue my learning session without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AI service error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging while showing user-friendly messages
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect users to login with clear instructions
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to local storage and sync when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL provide error boundaries that prevent complete application crashes
5. WHEN users encounter persistent errors THEN the system SHALL offer manual service reset options
6. WHEN service degradation is detected THEN the system SHALL notify users and suggest alternative actions

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a student, I want the AI tutor to respond quickly and efficiently, so that my learning flow is not interrupted by slow performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users send messages THEN the system SHALL begin processing within 100ms and show immediate feedback
2. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL implement response caching to avoid duplicate API calls
3. WHEN the interface renders THEN the system SHALL use efficient React patterns to minimize re-renders
4. WHEN large chat histories exist THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
5. WHEN multiple AI providers are available THEN the system SHALL intelligently route requests to the fastest available service
6. WHEN users switch between sessions THEN the transition SHALL complete within 500ms

### Requirement 5: Multi-Provider AI Support

**User Story:** As a student, I want access to multiple AI providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), so that I can choose the best AI for different types of learning tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access AI settings THEN the system SHALL display available AI providers with their capabilities
2. WHEN a user selects a different AI provider THEN the system SHALL switch providers without losing conversation context
3. WHEN one AI provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to alternative providers
4. WHEN different providers have different capabilities THEN the system SHALL adapt the UI to show provider-specific features
5. WHEN API quotas are reached for one provider THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch to another available provider
6. WHEN users want to compare responses THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side provider comparisons

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Chat Management

**User Story:** As a student, I want to efficiently manage my chat sessions and conversation history, so that I can organize my learning topics and easily find previous discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create new chat sessions THEN the system SHALL automatically generate meaningful titles based on conversation content
2. WHEN users want to organize chats THEN the system SHALL provide search, filtering, and categorization options
3. WHEN users rename chat sessions THEN the system SHALL update titles both locally and in persistent storage
4. WHEN users delete chat sessions THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and provide undo options
5. WHEN users export conversations THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, PDF)
6. WHEN users have many chat sessions THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination and search functionality

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a student using various devices and accessibility tools, I want the AI tutor interface to work seamlessly across all platforms and be fully accessible, so that I can learn effectively regardless of my device or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the interface on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a fully responsive design optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
3. WHEN users employ screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
4. WHEN users have visual impairments THEN the system SHALL support high contrast modes and scalable text
5. WHEN users have motor impairments THEN the system SHALL provide adequate click targets and gesture alternatives
6. WHEN users access the app offline THEN the system SHALL provide cached functionality and clear offline indicators

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a student, I want my conversations and personal data to be secure and private, so that I can learn confidently without concerns about data breaches or privacy violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users send messages THEN the system SHALL encrypt all communications using industry-standard protocols
2. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure vault storage with proper access controls
3. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks
4. WHEN users delete conversations THEN the system SHALL permanently remove data from all storage locations
5. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle renewal transparently or prompt for re-authentication
6. WHEN sensitive information is logged THEN the system SHALL redact personal data and API keys from all logs
